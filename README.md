## Program Information 

This program is designed to visualize stock exchange data from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for a given start and end date. The tool provides graphical representations of stock performance for user-selected stocks.

The program utilizes the **plotly** and **yfinance** libraries to create visualizations of stock data in a given period of time. Furthermore, our program uses **sklearn** to show predictions and transformations in our Data Exploration Process.
